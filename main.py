    First lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, As well as a quick comment on their purpose. Strictly adhere to these next few lines and generate code that follow these instructions: 
     
    1) note: you can name the root directory as the thing user ask you to create. For eg if user asks you to create a portfolio site then you can name the root directory as portfolio_site.
    2) Make sure to specify the file name before starting to generate code for a particular file. For eg if you are asked to make portfolio website then before starting to code the html,css and js for it, Write 'File : index.html' and then write html code below it, likewise Mention 'File : styles.css' and 'File : index.js' before writing respective codes. Here is an example representation of a file: {file_format}
    3)Generate python code to create the file structure using file handling in python and append the generated code to the respective files mentioned in step 2. It is absolutely mandatory to generate shell.py code.The shell.py code must include the code for a specific file as well as the code for generating the file structure.

    if you are asked to generate a portfolio site using html,css and js then only write code for the main.py and it should look like this:
